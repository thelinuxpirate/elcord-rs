#+title: Elcord-RS
* What is this?
Elcord-RS is a library I made in Rust which is supposed to make elcord's status
when interacting with X Windows apply new custom information.

This code is meant to be used with GNU Emacs' EXWM package...

** Features (Currently Working on...)
- Apply custom display status icon to a specific X Window buffer
- Use existing X Window data to then be displayed upon elcord
